                                  SzimatSzatyor                                 
===============================================================================

   SzimatSzatyor is a WoW (World of Warcraft) injector sniffer written in C++.
   A sniffer can log packets which are sent by the server and client.
   The code uses a lot of low-level C Windows API. Some info about the
   project name: Szimatszatyor is a Hungarian compound word, in English "szimat"
   means "sniff" or "flair", and "szatyor" means "bag". Also a Szimatszatyor
   is a bag which stores a gas mask. Nowadays it's a fashionable bag worn
   by some people. A picture of a Szimatszatyor: http://i.imgur.com/5elL0T9.jpg
   Szatyor.exe injects the DLL (szatyor.dll) into the client process and szatyor.dll
   is the sniffer which sniffs the packets to/from the client.

*FEATURES:
    - Can target specific WoW clients by name (default is WoW.exe) via passing
      an argument to the injector, usage: szatyor.exe [wow_exe_name]
    - Can detect the targeted WoW process build number to support
      multiple builds.
    - Can detect if multiple processes have the same
      name (which should be injected) and gives choice which should
      be injected.
    - Can detect if a process is already injected.
    - Dumps packets to a binary file which is can be parsed by
      TrinityCore's WowPacketParser which is available at here:
      https://github.com/TrinityCore/WowPacketParser
    - Has many commands useful for managing opcodes
    - Shows a console message with the opcode name when an opcode
      is dumped
    - Supports opcode names from virtually any client build

*USAGE:
    - You need szatyor.exe (the injector) and szimat.dll (the sniffer)
      in the same directory. Note: like other (most) sniffers this directory
      can be different than WoW's directory.
    - If you wish to have named opcodes in the console, place your
      Opcodes.h(new opcode system) or Opcodes.cpp(old opcode system) or
      Opcodes.cs(WowPacketParser) in the same directory as your DLL's
    - Start szatyor.exe
      Note: the user which started WoW should start that too, of course 
            admin user is also OK but not needed.
    - If you want to stop sniffing you can type 'quit' into the console
    - Log files are created to where SzimatSzatyor is.

CLIENT VERSIONS SUPPORTED:
    - See Offsets.ini file for list of supported builds

WARNING:
    An injector sniffer (like SzimatSzatyor) writes into WoW's memory
    at runtime. So Warden (Blizzard's anticheat) can detect it.
    However there have been no reported cases of being banned for using
    sniffer, so it is unlikely that using this program could get
    you banned.

COMPILATION:    
    If you want to compile SzimatSzatyor from the source code
    then you have to generate the project files for your compiler with CMake.
    CMake (http://www.cmake.org/) is an extensible, open-source
    system that manages the build process in an operating system
    and in a compiler-independent manner. You can download a GUI
    for your Windows OS and generate project files for example
    your Visual Studio.
    
    Note: The sniffer does not support 64-bit compilation.
